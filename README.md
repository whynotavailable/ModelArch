# ModelArch

This is ModelArch, a system for modeling complex architecture. Providing descriptive image generation, as well as
change management. In our case, change management is taking a A and B architectures, and proving a plan to go from A to B.

This is a small part of a larger system, with the ability to view, and manage architecture of an entire enterprise.
ModelArch is what teams will use to define and manage their models, with the bigger toolkit managing the enterprise.

## Rational

This system is written in nodejs specifically to make it easy for people to integrate with it. As the enterprise portion
of the system isn't actually needed for ModelArch itself to have value, I wanted to make it as easy as possible to use.
Nodejs is very easy to install on most systems.

The images we generate use SVG as the standard. This is simply because it's super easy to generate SVG images with exact
specification.

We use MIT as the license, because that'll make it as easy as possible for enterprises to adopt.

## What's Coming

Pretty much what I said on the tin. This is a relatively big project, and will take a large portion of this year to produce.
